# DR0002: Language Of Documentation
## STATUS
Proposed

## Context
Our documentation will be probably be too messy if we mix languages.

## Decision & Arguments
We can choose between two languages: English and Dutch.
We are native speakers in Dutch, but we are all used to English,
since it is the most used language in the software world (as we know it).
This decision records proposes to use English as our language of documentation.
It is industry standard to use English, and it helps making our code more accessible.

## Consequences
From now on, we will use English as our documentation language.
If we encounter use of Dutch in our documentation, we will correct
it and notify each other.
