# DR0004: Style API choice
## STATUS:
Accepted

## Context
As of yet unsure about what style API/UI to use. Group member found 3 candidates so far.

## Decision & Arguments
Options:
- Bootstrap
- Tailwind
- MUI

Bootstrap should offer a quick start but might not give complete control over all designs. Whereas if complete control is wanted Tailwind is a good option but might be more low-level. MUI is meant for REACT users that wish to follow the Material Design guidelines. Both Tailwind and MUI should in theory be harder to learn than Bootstrap. MUI is also based on a predefined design already whereas Bootstrap should be modifiable. Age-wise Bootstrap is the oldest and because of that should be close to being the most out-dated.

## Consequences
Due to short timeframe and learning curves Bootstrap has been chosen. It should be the easiest to learn out of the 3 options and still deliver plenty of flexibility. 
Both Tailwind and MUI should in theory be harder to learn. MUI is also based on a predefined design already whereas Bootstrap should be modifiable. 
Though it's the oldest of the 3 it should still be useable.
