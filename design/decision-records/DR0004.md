# DR0004: Style API choice
## STATUS:
Proposed

## Context
As of yet unsure about what style API/UI to use. Group member found 4 candidates so far.

## Decision & Arguments
Options:
- Bootstrap
- Tailwind
- MUI

So far not much concrete difference found. 
Bootstrap should offer a quick start but might not give complete control over all designs. Whereas if complete control is wanted Tailwind is a good option but might be more low-level. MUI is meant for REACT users that wish to follow the Material Design guidelines.
