# DR0001: Frontend language
## STATUS
Proposed

## Context
Unsure which frontend language would be better for this project. 

## Decision & Arguments
JavaScript (JS) and TypeScript (TS) are both very similar. 

JS is far more popular than TS ([Stack Overflow Trends](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=javascript%2Ctypescript)), it will be much easier to find help on the internet if things go wrong. 

TS has static typing, unlike JS, which means it:
- \+ is a lot clearer to see what a variable is storing
- \+ is easier to debug
- \+ is easier to predict what the code will do
- \- requires more typing 


## Consequences
We are going to use TypeScript as our frontend language for this project, there are no real arguments to use JavaScript over TS. 
We will need to learn TS, but considering that we already know JS and how similar they are, it should be fine.
