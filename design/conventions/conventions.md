# Coding Conventions

## Code
- Variable, method, function and package names should all be in English.
- Classnames in PascalCase, variable & method/function names in camelCase, packages in snake_case
- Use 4 space indents
- Only import necessary files (no import java.util.*;)
- Lines of code should not be longer than 100 characters

## Code (JS)
- End all lines with semicolons (like in Java)

## GitHub
- Do not push code that doesn't compile/work
- Before merging main, follow these steps
    1. Check out main
    2. Pull main
    3. Check out <your feature> branch
    4. Merge main with <your feature>
    5. Solve merge conflicts
    6. Make sure <your feature> (and main!) still works
    7. Push <your feature>
    8. Pull request
