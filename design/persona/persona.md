Persona:

Someone who wants to study for the Java OCA certification and in doing so wants to utilise practice-exams.
They want to recieve explanation about the subjects in question, check their results, compare results of different (completed) practice-exams.
Preferably not get repeat questions, and be able to select subjects (Maybe via a dropdown menu with advanced test settings in mind).
