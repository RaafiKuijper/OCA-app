Someone who wants to study for the Java OCA certification and in doing 
so wants to utilise practice-exams. 
They want to recieve explanation about the subjects in question, 
check their results, compare results of different (completed) practice-exams. 
Preferably not get repeat questions, and be able to select subjects 
(Maybe via a dropdown menu with advanced test settings in mind).
